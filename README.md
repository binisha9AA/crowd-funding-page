## My process

I created an object with my product items. I displayed them inside my modal and made a simple algorithm to sum my money, subtract product stock and add backers. I made my progress bar to compare all money needed to money collected. If any of items goes empty than it's going to be unabled to choose.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This project took me 37 hours of coding, thinking and searching for answers. I learned how to work with dialog html element and I practiced a lot of code with DOM manipulation. I created an object with my product items that is dynamically displayed inside my dialog element. From now on I will try to go further and start coding intermediate challenges.
